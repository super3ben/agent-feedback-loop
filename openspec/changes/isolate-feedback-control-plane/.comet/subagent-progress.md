# Subagent Progress

## Stable build boundary

- Change: `isolate-feedback-control-plane`
- Branch: `codex/isolate-feedback-control-plane`
- Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-16-immediate-subagent-reflection.md`
- Build mode: `subagent-driven-development`
- TDD mode: `tdd`
- Review mode: `thorough`
- Supported platforms: macOS and Linux
- Live boundary: global AFL hooks remain disabled; no real HOME/runtime/database changes are authorized
- Baseline: 216 tests, 215 passed; one legacy Stop hard-deadline timing test failed once and passed on isolated rerun

## Current task

- Plan task: `Task 1 complete: 并行建立轻量 control DB，不破坏旧 runtime`
- OpenSpec mappings: `1.2` audit and `4.4` lean SQLite are partial until their later mapped implementation tasks complete
- Stage: `implementing`
- Dispatch: pending fresh implementer
- Implementation base: pending coordination commit
- Implementation commits: pending
- RED evidence: pending
- GREEN evidence: pending
- Review round: 0 of 2
- Review result: pending
- Unresolved findings: none

## Superseded implementation

- Former notification/receipt/Stop work in `7d6b1e3..9c89e00` is evidence to audit, not accepted completion under the new design.
- Reusable generic primitives may survive only after Task 1 audit; notification, Stop, episode, maintenance and scheduler runtime paths must be removed by their mapped tasks.
